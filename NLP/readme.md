# hello

CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 20.00 MiB (GPU 0; 1.95 GiB total capacity; 896.05 MiB already allocated; 17.62 MiB free; 956.00 MiB reserved in total by PyTorch) If reserved memory is >> allocated memory try setting max_split_size_mb to avoid fragmentation.  See documentation for Memory Management and PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF
